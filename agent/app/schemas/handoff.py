"""Supervisor-worker handoff contracts (W2_ARCHITECTURE.md §2; canonical home, W2-M6).

``SupervisorDecision`` and ``ReasonCode`` are the CLOSED enums of the supervisor-worker
boundary (§2 locked-decision): a worker cannot smuggle a new decision or an invented
reason code past validation. Each reason code is legal for exactly ONE decision
(``_ALLOWED_REASONS``), so the vocabulary is closed in both dimensions. ``HandoffRecord``
is strict Pydantic v2 (``extra="forbid"``, ``strict=True``, frozen) — one audited
supervisor-worker hop, with ``input_ref``/``output_ref`` as trace-addressable ids (refs,
never raw values, cross the handoff boundary — §2 WorkerInput/WorkerOutput rule).

This is the CANONICAL home for these classes (W2-M6): ``app.orchestrator.state``
re-exports the SAME class objects by identity so the M3 orchestrator and the schema
inventory can never drift into two parallel ``HandoffRecord`` shapes.
